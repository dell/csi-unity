**Repository for CSI Driver for Dell Unity XT**

## Description
CSI Driver for Unity XT is part of the [CSM (Container Storage Modules)](https://github.com/dell/csm) open-source suite of Kubernetes storage enablers for Dell products. CSI Driver for Unity XT is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that provides support for provisioning persistent storage using Dell Unity XT storage array. 

It supports CSI specification version 1.5.

This project may be compiled as a stand-alone binary using Golang that, when run, provides a valid CSI endpoint. It also can be used as a precompiled container image.
