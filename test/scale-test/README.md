# Helm charts and scripts for scalability tests

## Helm charts
| Name       | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| 2volumes   | Creates 2 volumes per pod/replica
| 10volumes  | Creates 10 volumes per pod/replica
| 20volumes  | Creates 20 volumes per pod/replica
| 30volumes  | Creates 30 volumes per pod/replica
| 50volumes  | Creates 50 volumes per pod/replica
| 100volumes | Creates 100 volumes per pod/replica


## Scripts
| Name           | Usage |
|----------------|-------|
| scaletest.sh   | Script to start the scalability tests
| rescaletest.sh | Script to rescale pods to a different number of replicas


## Scale test prerequisites
* Works only on helm v3
* Make sure the driver is installed and running fine in the k8s cluster
* The namespace that is to be used for the scale test should be pre-created in the k8s cluster and make sure no objects are present under the namespace.
* The right storage class to be used for the test should be pre-created and specified as StorageClassName in values.yaml under the test folder that is to be run.


## scaletest.sh
The test is run using the script file scaletest.sh in the directory test/scale-tests. The script takes the below arguments.
-r : number of replicas for the statefulset 
-t : the test name to be run [default: 2volumes]
-n : namespace to be used to run the test [default: test]

Examples:

To scale the statefulset to 3 resplicas and then re-scale it back to 0 replicas
./scaletest.sh -r 3 -t 10volumes -n test

To rescale the statefulset to 2 replicas
sh rescaletest.sh -r 0 -t 10volumes -n test
