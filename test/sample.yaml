# This test creates 2 different PersistentVolumeClaims
# These PVCs use ext4 and xfs default storage classes
# PVs are mounted to pod from StatefulSet
#
# To test the driver just run from root directory of repository
# > kubectl create -f ./tests/sample/
#
# You can find all resources in unity namespace.
# Check if pod is created and Ready and Running by running
# > kubectl get all -n unity
# (if it's in CrashLoopback state then driver installation wasn't successful, check logs of node and controller)
# After that can go into created container and check if everything is mounted correctly.
#
# After that you can uninstall the testing PVCs and StatefulSet
# > kubectl delete -f ./tests/simple/
